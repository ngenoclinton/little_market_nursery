          This room provides a stimulating, warm environment for your child to enjoy through various activities.
          There&apos;s also a sensory area (which is available to all children), an outdoor garden which gives them
          plenty of room to move around.

        <p className="mb-4">
          All nursery activities are based on the EYFS covering the seven areas, and the children get to build on their
          previous knowledge by developing new interests and trying out new experiences such as learning languages like
          French and Spanish.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
          Each child has a key-person who will work in close partnership with parents/carers, providing a daily
          communication book so you know what your child has experienced in the day.
